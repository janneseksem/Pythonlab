Project-1: Console-Based Blackjack Game
Overview

This project is a simple console-based implementation of the popular card game Blackjack.
How to Play

    The rules are implemented within the code.
    The game starts immediately: the player is dealt the first and third card, while the dealer receives the second card.
    Use the command hit to draw another card or stand to keep your current hand.
    The game ends when either the player or the dealer wins.
    After the game ends, the player can choose to play again by entering y, or exit the game with n.

Getting Started

To run the game, simply execute the Python script in a console. Make sure you have Python 3.x installed.
